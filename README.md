## Project Description

This project focuses on the **design and simulation of several control methods** for a **simple 3-DoF articulated robot**. It includes the development of the **robot model**, analysis of **kinematics**, **Jacobian matrix**, and **dynamics**, **trajectory planning**, and the **implementation and simulation of various controllers** in MATLAB/**Simulink**. The goal is to explore how different control strategies perform in tracking desired trajectories for the simplified PUMA robot.

## Robot Model

The project utilizes a **simplified 3-DoF articulated PUMA robot**. This robot configuration features **three revolute joints**, similar to a human arm. Articulated robots are the most common configuration for industrial robots. The selected articulated robot is the same as PUMAâ€™s robot first part which yields to the robot end effector position. The robot consists of three revolute joints which implies **3 DoF in task space**. The configuration of the simplified PUMA robot is shown in the right side of Figure 1.

Key aspects of the robot model covered include:
*   **3-DoF Articulated Structure**
*   **Direct Kinematics**: Defining the end-effector coordinates based on joint angles. This is a mapping from joint space to the coordinate space.
*   **Jacobian Matrix**: Concluded from velocity analysis for the robot. The derivative of the Jacobian is also defined.
*   **Direct Dynamics**: Establishing the dynamic equation, including definitions for mass, length, distance to center of mass, and moment of inertia parameters. The dynamic model involves inertia (M), Coriolis/centrifugal (C), and gravity (G) matrices. The dynamic equation is based on the D-H rule.
*   **Parameters Vector (theta)**: Used in the dynamic model.

## Controller Design Methods

The project explores the implementation and **simulation** of a variety of control strategies:

*   **PD Controller**: A basic Proportional-Derivative controller, omitting gravity terms in the design. The Simulink design is shown in Figure 2.
*   **PD + Gravity Controller**: A PD controller augmented to include compensation for gravity effects. The Simulink design is shown in Figure 4.
*   **Inverse Dynamics Control**: This category includes methods that aim to cancel out the robot's complex dynamics:
    *   **PD Inverse Dynamics**. The Simulink simulation is shown in Figure 6.
    *   **Robust Inverse Dynamics**. The Simulink simulation is shown in Figure 8.
    *   **Adaptive Inverse Dynamics**: This method involves online estimation of robot parameters. The Simulink simulation is shown in Figure 10.
*   **Passivity Based Control**: Controllers designed based on the concept of system passivity:
    *   **PD Passivity Based**. The Simulink simulation is shown in Figure 12.
    *   **Robust Passivity Based**. The Simulink simulation is shown in Figure 14.
    *   **Adaptive Passivity Based**. The Simulink simulation is shown in Figure 16.

## Trajectory Planning

Desired trajectories for the robot joint angles are generated (Joint Space). The primary method involves assuming the initial and final position, velocity, and acceleration between time 0 to 5 seconds. Specific initial/final conditions are defined for `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3`. This yields polynomial trajectory equations. An M-file named `trajectoryPlanning` is mentioned to obtain the trajectory.
* You can change the trajectory planning scenario on your own through the trajectory planning MATLAB code and the reflection in Simulink.

## Simulation Environment

The project is implemented and extensively simulated using **MATLAB** and **Simulink**. The core of the controller implementation and testing is done through **Simulink models**.

## Assumptions

The simulations are based on specific assumed parameters for the robot and controllers.

**Robot Parameters:** The robot parameters are considered as follows:
*   m1 = 1, m2 = 1, m3 = 1 (masses)
*   l1 = 1, l2 = 1, l3 = 1 (lengths)
*   r1 = l1/2, r2 = l2/2, r3 = l3/2 (distances from center of mass to axis of rotation)
*   R1 = 0.05, R2 = 0.05, R3 = 0.05
*   g = 9.81 (gravity)

## Getting Started

To run the simulations:
1.  Ensure you have **MATLAB** and **Simulink** installed. (Specific version that I used: **MATLAB R2022b**).
2.  Clone this repository.
3.  Open the project files in MATLAB.
4.  The project contains **Simulink (`.slx`) files for each controller simulation** and for more information M-files for trajectory generation (e.g., `trajectoryPlanning.m`).
5.  Open and run the desired **Simulink models**.

## Simulation Results

The simulations performed for each controller result in trajectory tracking performance data. The source material includes figures illustrating the **error** over time for each implemented controller. These figures demonstrate the effectiveness of each control strategy.

## Formulas and References

The theory behind each controller comes from this reference: C. Canudas de Wit, B. Siciliano, and G. Bastin, Theory of Robot Control. Berlin, Germany: Springer, 1996.
You can read the formulas in mentioned book and don't hesitate to ask me question about the theory.
